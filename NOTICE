This program is part of IMAGINARY (www.imaginary.org) by the
Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach (www.mfo.de). It was
originally developed for and in collaboration with the National Museum
of Mathematics (www.momath.org).

The design of the program was done in collaboration with Moey Inc
(http://moeyinc.com/), the company who also produced the hardware and
hardware-software connection of the first exhibit.
