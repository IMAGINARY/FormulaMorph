          <p>This software allows to explore the beauty of algebraic surfaces using real time visualizations. The user can select two algebraic surfaces from a predefined list and interactively modify surface parameters in order to achieve deformations. Both surfaces are interpolated ("morphed") so that a third surface is created. In most cases, the results are very aesthetical and astonishing!</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/IMAGINARY/FormulaMorph/gh-pages/images/FormulaMorphScreenShot.png" alt="FormulaMorph screen shot"></p>

<p>This virtual exhibit is designed to be controlled using physical input devices (wheels, levers, buttons). A software panel is provided for testing purposes.</p>

<h1>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h1>

<p>Clone the repository locally and test it using</p>

<pre><code>./gradlew run
</code></pre>

<p>Once the main screen shows up, you need to perform a right click on the window to bring up the software control panel. There are essentially three ways to connect physical input devices to FormulaMorph:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build your own combination of <a href="http://www.phidgets.com/">Phidgets</a> together with [Link to AH's Phidget controller (not yet online)]. This has been used at the MoMath NYC:
<img src="https://raw.github.com/IMAGINARY/FormulaMorph/gh-pages/images/FormulaMorphAtMoMath.jpg" alt="FormulaMorph exhibit at the MoMath">
</li>
<li>Use whatever input devices you like and communicate with FormulaMorph via the simple <a href="#network-protocol">network protocol</a> defined below. This requires to implement your own software layer which abstracts from the physical devices. You don't need to modify the FormulaMorph soruce code.</li>
<li>Add support for other devices directly into the ForumulaMorph code.</li>
</ol><h1>
<a name="network-protocol" class="anchor" href="#network-protocol"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Network protocol</h1>

<p>FormulaMorph can be controlled via the network. It acts as a client that connects to the server and port given in the file <a href="settings.properties">settings.properties</a>. The protocol itself is best explained using an example session.</p>
